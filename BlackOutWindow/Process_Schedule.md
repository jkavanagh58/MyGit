## **Synch CCM to OM**

**Start Script**:  23:00 Sunday preceding patch week

### Synch Questions

Above scheduled is proposed based on thought all groups will be updated at once
Do we want to run a daily run? Sunday night for Monday windows, Monday night for Tuesday windows
Service Account to be used to run this script?

### Feedback

08.08.2017: Start scripts before 23:00 to allow for troubleshooting

## **Schedule MaintenanceMode**

**Start Script**:	Run once synch script has completed on Sunday evening

### Schedule Questions

Scheduling would be adjusted if Synch process is changed based on Sych Question answers

### Feedback

08.08.2017: Scripts run complete, not broken into daily runs at this time.

## **Reporting**

**Start Script**:	OnDemand

### Reporting Questions

For reference and auditing it might be desirable to run on a schedule to coincide with Synch process
